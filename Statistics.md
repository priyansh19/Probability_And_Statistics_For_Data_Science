
# Mean:

Also known as average of the given series. 

Formula : Sum of the numbers / Total numbers of samples.  

# Median:

Sort the values , and taking the value at the middle.
Median is less susceptible to outliers than mean
 
Formula: If no are odd then simply the value at the middle will be the median andd if the no. of values are even then you have to sum the values at the center and divide it by 2.
 
# Mode:

The common value in a dataset and it is not relevant to continous data distribution

Formula: the most occuring value in the dataset is the mode of the data

# Standard deviation and variance :

> Outlier is a numerical values that are far away from the other dataset values.

They are all about the shape or the distribution of data

Variance (sigma)^2 is simply the **average of the squared diffrences from the mean**.

Standard deviation (sigma) is just the square root of the variance term. It is the most important variable as it is used to identify the outliers in the dataset
  
You can talk about standard deviation in sucha way that how extreme a data points is by talking about "how many standard deviations  " away from the mean it is

In Sample Variance the only diffrence is when we finally divide the sum of squares of the diffrences by the **total no of datapoints - 1** this is the only diffrence betweeen S^2 and sigma^2.

As the presence of the outliers effect the mean of the data set by a huge amount of magnitude hence it also effects the standard deviation     

Normal distribution curve is also known as the proability density curve. It gives you the prbability of the data points falling within some given range of values.

probability mass function is used for visualising the discrete values ocourring in the dataset
